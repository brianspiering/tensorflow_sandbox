Exploring TensorFlow
----

[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is an "open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs."

TensorFlow is very good (and also fun to use).

The code is in Python 3.5. If you need help setuping up your machine, check out `setup_env.sh`.
